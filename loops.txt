loops:

1.handling repetitive tasks.
2. execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. 


for-loop:  (if you know how many iterations you need to perform)

for (initialization; testing condition; increment/decrement) {
    statement(s)
}

while loop: 
--->when you don't know the number of iterations in advance
-->entry control loop-checks condition first and executes the statement

while (boolean condition) {
    loop statements...
}


do-while: (exit control loop-it checks for the condition after executing the statements)

do {
    Statements...
}
while (condition);


for-in loop: 

--->Iterates over the keys or properties of an object -including arrays 
--->For arrays, it loops over the index values,
---> Best suited for iterating over the properties of an object or the indices of an array.

for(let variable_name in object_name) {
    // Statement
}


for-of loop:
---> Iterates over the values of an iterable (like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.)
--->It directly accesses the value of each element rather than its index or key.
--->Best suited for iterating over arrays, strings, or any iterable where you care about the values themselves.


for(let variable_name of  object_name) {
    // Statement
}



forEach:
-->The forEach method in JavaScript is an array method used to iterate over the elements of an array.


eg:
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

numbers.forEach(function(value) {
  console.log(value);
});
// Output:
// 10
// 20
// 30
// 40
